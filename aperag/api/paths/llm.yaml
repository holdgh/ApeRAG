    summary: Create embeddings
    description: |
      Generate embeddings for the given input text(s) using the specified provider and model.
      This endpoint is compatible with OpenAI's embeddings API format, but includes an additional
      'provider' parameter to specify which LLM provider to use.
      
      The endpoint supports both single text inputs and batch processing of multiple texts.
      It requires the provider to be configured in the user's Model Service Provider (MSP) settings
      with a valid API key.

rerank:
  post:
    summary: Rerank documents
    description: |
      Rerank a list of documents based on their relevance to a given query using the specified 
      provider and model. This endpoint follows the industry-standard rerank API format used by
      providers like Cohere, Jina AI, and others.
      
      The endpoint supports both simple text lists and structured document objects with metadata.
      Documents are returned ordered by relevance score (highest first), with optional top_k 
      filtering to limit the number of results.
      
      The provider must be configured in the user's Model Service Provider (MSP) settings
      with a valid API key and support rerank functionality.
