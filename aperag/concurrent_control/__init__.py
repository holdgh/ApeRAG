Universal Concurrent Control Module

A flexible and reusable concurrent control system that provides unified locking
mechanisms for any Python application. Designed to handle different deployment
scenarios and task queue environments.

Features:
- Auto-managed locks with default manager
- Flexible timeout support
- Universal applicability
- Easy extensibility
- Production ready with comprehensive error handling

Quick Start:
    from aperag.concurrent_control import get_or_create_lock, lock_context

    # Create/get a managed lock (most common usage)
    my_lock = get_or_create_lock("database_operations")

    # Use with default behavior
    async with my_lock:
        await critical_work()

    # Use with timeout
    async with lock_context(my_lock, timeout=5.0):
        await critical_work()
